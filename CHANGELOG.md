# What changed

Newest first. One version number covers the desktop app, the phone app and
the backend files (the `VERSION` file). Builds made by GitHub add a build
number as the last part - `0.2.57` is a build of 0.2.

## Not in a numbered version yet

- **A red panda face** - the first animal among Jarvis's faces, on the
  desktop and the phone. It sleeps when Jarvis is on standby, perks its ears
  and tilts its head when listening, gazes into a glowing orb when thinking,
  talks with Jarvis's voice, waves when an approval is waiting, and scratches
  its head at an error. The orb is your colour for each state. Drawn in 3D
  by the graphics card with no model file; see `docs/CRITTERS.md`.
- **A pygmy owl and a sea otter** join the panda, on both apps. The owl
  perches on a branch, turns its head to follow the room and waves a wing
  when something is waiting on you; the otter floats on its back in a
  little pool, taps a glowing pebble while it thinks and covers its eyes
  with its paws to sleep.
- **Animal faces tidied after their audit:** no more see-through specks
  along the otter's outline against its pool; the owl's thinking orb now
  circles clear of its head, and its glow no longer shows through the face;
  no starburst of streaks on the owl's crown seen from above; the panda's
  tail no longer shades itself with a false shadow band.
- **The animals' mouths follow Jarvis's real voice.** Each spoken answer is
  read up front into a mouth track - how open, how wide ("ee"), how round
  ("oo"), shut in pauses and on m/b/p - and played in step with the sound
  you actually hear, on the PC (every window that shows a face) and the
  phone. When Jarvis answers without speaking (typed, Quiet mode, kept on
  screen), the animals keep their mouths shut. See `docs/LIPSYNC.md`.
- **Voice follows the face.** With the red panda, owl or otter showing,
  Jarvis's built-in voice becomes that animal's - its own voice, pace and a
  slightly higher pitch. A switch in both apps, on to start, right under
  "Jarvis's built-in voice"; it never asks first. A voice you recorded still
  wins.

**Fixed**

- **Desktop security update.** The desktop app's framework (Tauri) goes from
  2.11.5 to 2.11.6, which closes a published hole (GHSA-w28w-mhc8-qvjv) where
  one window of an app could read data queued for another window. Jarvis has
  several windows and streams chat answers that way, so it was affected.
- **Speech and memory-search models no longer report to Microsoft.** The
  library that runs them (ONNX Runtime) has its own usage reports switched on
  by default. Jarvis now switches them off before any model loads. One copy
  inside the speech engine can't be reached this way; Windows' own "Send
  optional diagnostic data" switch covers that one (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md §4).
- **A fact you forget no longer comes back by itself.** Jarvis re-reads the
  whole chat when it learns, so about a minute after you pressed Forget (or
  Erase), the same sentence could be saved again without asking. Now nothing
  is learned again from the lines it had already read in that chat, and if
  you say a forgotten fact again later, it waits for your yes.

**Faster**

- **Jarvis speaks sooner.** Speech-to-text and the voice now use 4 processor
  threads instead of 2 on a PC with cores to spare (2 on a small one), which
  measured about 0.3 s sooner to the first sound. Your own `stt_threads` /
  `tts_threads` setting still wins.
- **The model's settings file explains the real memory check.** The notes in
  `backend/jarvis-primary.Modelfile` were out of date about flash attention.
  They now give the one PowerShell line that shows whether the whole model is
  on the graphics card ("offloaded 37/37").

**Smaller fixes**

- **The model tool test is fair to other models.** A model that loads with
  too short a conversation is skipped with a plain message saying how to fix
  it, `--repeat` saves the worst of several runs, and a model maker's own
  settings can be tried (`tools/tool_eval/README.md`).
- **The smartwatch setting says a ringing alarm may stay on the phone.**
  Watches often skip notifications that keep going until you stop them.

## 0.2.0 - 26 September 2026

The first numbered version. It gathers the work of the last few days.

**New things Jarvis can do**

- **Timers, alarms, reminders and to-do lists**, set by saying or typing
  them, answered without the AI model so they work even when it is busy or
  asleep. Plain repeating reminders and alarms need no approval card.
  "What did I miss?" sums up what went off while you were away.
- **Morning briefing**: today's calendar, new emails (how many, and from
  whom - or only how many, if you prefer), and what is coming up.
- **"Tell me when ..."**: an email from a named sender, or a device at home
  changing (the washing machine finishing). One approval card to set it up;
  a match only notifies you - urgent ones keep ringing on the phone until
  you look.
- **"Folders Jarvis may look in"**: add a folder on the PC (one approval
  card) and ask about the files in it - find them by name, search your notes,
  read PDF, Word, Excel and PowerPoint files a part at a time. "Bring in a
  Notion export" unzips your Notion export into one of those folders. What
  Jarvis reads there is never saved as a fact about you.
- **Instant "tell me when" for email**, and **"tell me if Alex hasn't
  replied by Friday"**.
- **Sending email**: one approval card per email, showing the exact
  recipients, subject and whole text. Never an "always allow".
- **Web search** with five providers to choose from (SearXNG on your own PC
  by default, DuckDuckGo, Exa, Tavily, Brave).
- **Google Calendar**, read-only, through its private link, set on the PC.
- **Focus sessions** on the PC: a timer plus Quiet, a spoken nudge when a
  distraction comes to the front, and a report at the end. Nothing leaves
  the PC, and what was on screen is never stored.
- **Stop everything**: Alt+Shift+X on the desktop, or the button on the
  phone, halts whatever Jarvis is doing at once.
- **A live check of the whole setup** (`selftest.py --preflight`): every
  real connection tested end to end, "N pass, N fail, N warn".
- **"What asks first"**, a page in both apps listing every action and
  whether it asks you, with switches to make things stricter.
- **Lights, plugs and fans without a card** - a setting, off by default.
  Locks, doors, alarms and covers always ask.
- **Memory**: Jarvis learns facts from your own words automatically, lists
  each one with Forget and "Erase the words", and still asks about
  sensitive topics. Chat history is kept on the PC, encrypted, with a switch
  to turn it off. "Who is my sister?" now works.
- **Voice**: "Hey Jarvis" on the PC and the phone, spoken-style answers that
  start at the first comma, interrupting by saying "stop", and a switch for
  the "I heard you" sound (off by default).
- **Warm or plain manner**, a setting in both apps.

**Safer**

- Both apps accept a Jarvis address on your own networks only (this PC, the
  home network, Tailscale, NordVPN Meshnet). A public tunnel is refused.
- The PC itself asks Windows Hello before a risky approval from the PC, and
  a risky approval needs a screen lock on the phone or Windows Hello on the
  PC.
- Plain `http://` to Home Assistant or the calendar only inside your own
  networks.
- Writing notes after Jarvis has read outside text (an email, a web page)
  asks first.
- App lock hides the approval widget's details on the PC, and blocks
  screenshots on the phone.
- Reading email now checks the mail server's certificate, as sending
  always did (it encrypted, but to whoever answered).

**Fixed**

- "What did I miss?" no longer lists every routine "tell me when" look as
  something that went off.
- A "tell me when" whose end date passed while the PC was asleep (or while
  it was paused) now simply ends, instead of looking one more time.
- On the two days a year the clocks change, the briefing's calendar covers
  the whole day, midnight to midnight.
- The "tell me when" approval card no longer ends by saying it sends
  nothing anywhere, which contradicted its own "How" line.
- Many smaller fixes from the bug audits of 19, 24 and 26 September
  (`docs/BUG-AUDIT-2026-09-26-*.md`).

**Packaging**

- One version number (0.2.0) for the desktop app, the phone app and the
  backend. Both About boxes show it, the maker (darknight11ish), the licence
  and a way to read the third-party notices.
- Complete third-party notices for the desktop (`THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.txt`,
  regenerated by `tools/gen_notices.py`) and a new list inside the phone app.
- Phone and desktop downloads are published only from `main` and the
  working branch; shorter, plainer release notes with a checksum.
