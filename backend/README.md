# The backend patch for `/api/appearance`

`appearance.patch` adds the two routes the Faces window already speaks, so a
face chosen on the desktop is the face the phone wears. Without it the picker
still works and saves — it just says, every time, that the choice stayed on
this machine.

## Apply it

```powershell
cd "C:\Users\pcadmin\Documents\Claude\Open jarvis files\Desktop program"
copy jarvis_hud.py jarvis_hud.py.bak
git apply --verbose path\to\appearance.patch
```

No git in that folder? `patch -p1 < appearance.patch`, or apply the four edits
by hand — the patch is 200 lines and three of the four are one-liners.

Then restart the backend and press **save** in Faces. The line under the
buttons should change from *"saved on this machine only"* to *"saved to Jarvis
— the phone sees this too"*.

## What it adds

| | |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/appearance` | The stored document. Joins the existing desktop-only surfaces, so it carries the same origin and token checks as `/api/models` and `/api/config`. |
| `POST /api/appearance` | Writes it. Joins the existing gated-action tuple and dispatches through `_desktop_action`, like every other write. |
| `~/.openjarvis/appearance.json` | Where it lives — beside `config.toml`, not inside it. |
| an `appearance` event | Published on save, so a client that is already open repaints. Clients that do not know the kind ignore it. |

It does not touch anything else. No existing route changes behaviour.

## Why it is shaped this way

**It is cosmetic, so it is not gated.** The document decides how Jarvis looks.
It approves nothing, starts nothing and reveals nothing, so it needs no
approval and should never grow one. If a field would ever change *behaviour*
rather than appearance, it belongs on a different route.

**It rejects rather than clamps.** An unknown pattern or colour comes back 400
naming the offender. Silently dropping a bad binding would leave the picker
showing a choice that is in effect nowhere, which is worse than refusing and
worse than storing something odd.

**A machine without the spec stores anyway, and says so.** The server never
needed `jarvis-visual-spec.json` before, so it may not have one. Refusing every
write in that case would brick the feature the route exists to enable; instead
the reply carries `"note": "stored without checking it against the visual
spec"`. To get validation, drop a copy of the spec next to `jarvis_hud.py` or
in `~/.openjarvis/`.

**The server stamps `updated`, not the client.** Two devices with two clocks
are the case that field exists to arbitrate, so the one machine both of them
talk to owns it. Last write wins — there is one owner here, and a merge
strategy would be machinery for a conflict that does not happen.

**The write is atomic.** Written to a temporary file and renamed, because a
half-written file here means the owner's face silently reverting.

**`/api/config` was the obvious home and is not one.** It is a deliberate 501:
that file decides what Jarvis may do unattended, and the refusal explains why a
half-built editor for it would be worse than none. Appearance has no such
weight and should not sit behind that review.

## Test it

```
python3 backend/test_appearance.py "path/to/patched/jarvis_hud.py"
```

Fourteen checks against the real `jarvis-visual-spec.json`: that all fifty
colours are found, that an unknown colour is refused rather than dropped, that
`banked` is accepted, that a refused save leaves the stored document untouched,
that a save publishes an event, that a machine without the spec says so, and
that a corrupt file reports itself instead of taking the surface down.

Two of those exist because `python -m py_compile` passed while the patch was
broken twice: `time` was never imported, so every save would have raised
`NameError`; and the palette walk looked for `families[].shades[]`, which does
not exist — the fifty colours are a flat `palette.colors` — so colour checking
was silently finding nothing and passing everything.
